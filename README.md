# ChatGPT x Unity: Generative AI "TV Show"
This innovative project combines the OpenAI ChatGPT API with either Microsoft or Google Text-To-Speech APIs to create an immersive and never-ending AI TV show experience. The process begins with ChatGPT generating a compelling plot for an episode, complete with engaging dialogues. The output is then formatted into JSON, facilitating easy extraction of dialogue data.

Utilizing this data, the application dynamically generates audio for each speaker, assigning gender-specific voices based on their names. These audio elements, along with laughter tracks, random actions, camera switches, and dialogue audio files, are seamlessly integrated into a Unity Timeline. While the generated episode plays, another one is generated.

The application goes a step further by incorporating NPC (non-player character) interactions, such as characters looking at each other, performing animations, walking around, or engaging in various actions. The result is a continuous and dynamic AI-driven TV show experience that brings together storytelling, audio synthesis, and visual elements.

And it's still very much not finished.
